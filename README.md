6.Defect prevention at an early stage of project life cycle
7.It can determine all the decision points and paths used in the application, which allows you to increase test coverage
8.Gaps in requirements, test cases and defects at unit level and code level can be found in an easy way




D. How would you use them to improve your testing?


review is very key thing in testing and each phase of testing review should be incorporate,testcases coverage should be cover with the scenario and scenario should be derived from requirement and this the flow of writing test cases and also review the test cases.

Testcase should be written to have focus of risk and the static and dynamic technique implemented as the measurement of test cases is the fault found which is actully increase the confidence.for writing the test cases many thing needs to keep focus as company to company process would be different but the concept of test case coverage should be define with the requirement and all the possible combination.

There are different type of test cases review process and its define as below
