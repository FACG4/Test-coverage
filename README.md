# Test-coverage
here the 4 things you should do first to tame the beast and improve test coverage:
1. Add the Right Test
  i. Create tests as you fix bugs
  ii. Create tests with all new features
  iii. Create tests as you add to old features
  iv. Create tests in identified risk areas
  
2. Turn on Code Coverage
For this to be useful, follow these steps:
  I. Start running code coverage against all your code
  II.Get a baseline
