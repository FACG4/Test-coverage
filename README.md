Test coverage

Measurement of Coverage can be determined by the following formula.

Coverage= Number of coverage items exercised / Total number of coverage items *100%.

It should be kept in mind that 100% code coverage does not mean that the application is 100% tested.  An application with high code coverage means it has been more thoroughly tested and would contain less software bugs than an application with low code coverage. There are numerous ways to calculate code coverage like program subroutines and program statements called during the execution of test suite.


review is very key thing in testing and each phase of testing review should be incorporate,testcases coverage should be cover with the scenario and scenario should be derived from requirement and this the flow of writing test cases and also review the test cases.

Testcase should be written to have focus of risk and the static and dynamic technique implemented as the measurement of test cases is the fault found which is actully increase the confidence.for writing the test cases many thing needs to keep focus as company to company process would be different but the concept of test case coverage should be define with the requirement and all the possible combination.

There are different type of test cases review process and its define as below

#1. Understand the fundamentle ,Before writting ( try to do some paper work before wrting test case )

#2. Do self review and try to find the improvement not mistake

#3. Ask developer/technicale expert for review.

#4. Do review updated testcase
